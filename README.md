This script contains tests to validate the response from a request.
- *Test 1: Request is succeed*
This test checks that the request was successful by verifying that the response status code is 200.
- *Test 2: Response delay is accepted*
This test checks that the response time is within an acceptable range by verifying that the response time is below 1000 milliseconds.

### Contents Response Validation

- *Test 1: User `'id'` is generated* <br>
This test checks that the 'id' field in the response body is not empty.
- *Test 2: `'token'` is generated* <br>
